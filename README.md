# Find-citations-from-the-paper-0.1-
When publish a paper, the citation apeared in the text need to apear in the reference list. However, such check is very time consuming, especially you have a relatively long paper.
This project will include codes that can output the potential citations from the paper.

How to use it:
1. copy all the content of the paper (only for windows, because the input function in R is only used in windows)
2. set the saving pathway at the end of the code
3. run the code

Hope can be helpful!
